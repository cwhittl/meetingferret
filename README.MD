# Meeting Ferret

This application is to allow someone to send an link to multiple people across multiple email services to find the best time available for them to meet. Then allow them to add it to their callendar.

This is starting as a way for me to brush up on Python, Typescript, and whatever frontend I decide to use - #nojudgment
